## üìã Describe the SmartBlock
<!-- Short and concise description of how the SmartBlock works and its purpose -->

I created a SmartBlock to quickly build an Eisenhower Matrix using Roam's existing `{{kanban}}` functionality


## ‚úÖ Describe any prerequisites or dependencies that are required for this SmartBlock
<!-- List any required roam/js extensions, roam/css, other SmartBlocks etc. -->

- Requires `#matrix` tag to be inline __and__ preceeding `{{kanban}}`
  - eg. `#matrix {{kanban}}`
- Requires the following CSS to exist **at the top** of your `roam/css` page:
```css
@import url('https://itsjustmath.github.io/roam-matrix/matrix.css');
```

If styles aren't being applied, its likely because you need to move any `@import` to the top of `roam/css` (above any custom [longhand] CSS you've written).

Or if you don't want to use `@import`, you can copy/paste this [matrix.css](https://itsjustmath.github.io/roam-matrix/matrix.css) into your graph.
